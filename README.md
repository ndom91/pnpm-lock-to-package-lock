# `pnpm-lock.yaml` Convertor

A lot of JS tooling only takes a `package-lock.json` file as input. This tool converts a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to a `package-lock.json` file. Uses `pnpm` internal packages for parsing to try to be as accurate as possible.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
2. Ensure you have a `pnpm-lock.yaml` in your repositories root directory
2. Run `pnpm dev`
